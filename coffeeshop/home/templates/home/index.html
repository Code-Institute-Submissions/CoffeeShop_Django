But for a true coffee lover, the relationship they want and need is found every morning (noon and night sometimes!) at the bottom of their favorite mug. Black, cream, sugar, foam, no foam, these preferences can easily divide nations, it seems, because people LOVE their coffee in a way and often don't move to change it. Growing up in Seattle, where Starbucks is the mothership, and artisanal coffees are found on every corner, I grew up thinking that coffee and coffee culture was a normal way of life. But for many people, coffee is just what gets you moving in the morning. You fill your thermos or travel mug with whatever you've ground up or in a capsule and you're ready for the day.</p>
